# Callow

Callow is a dead simple brute force tool for websites with simple structures.

> **Note:** *This project currentry only supports windows*

<sup>This project is basically a fork of [metachar/Hatch](https://github.com/metachar/Hatch) but I wanted to develop it independently. Being a fork of a parent project, Callow respects and inherits the same license terms of Hatch.</sup>

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome
- [Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

Callow currently ships with ChromeDriver 80.0.3987.106 and hence supports Chrome 80 and quite possibly any future versions of chrome. For older versions of chrome, replace the `chromedriver.exe` with the version compatible with your version of chrome.

## Installation
